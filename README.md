# Holiday-Lights-Display-System

This project is about creating a server process to control some lights driven by microcontrollers.
It is meant to run on a traditional desktop computer that is connected to a couple of arduinos with
ethernet shields on them. It is meant to allow you select from a couple of shows (you program the
shows yourself) held in an SQLite database or you can let the server generate the show to the music
based on frequency analysis.

#Depends on
